# Introduction to ImageJ2 Scripting

(Mafalda Sousa, acknowledged to Jan Eglinger )

This exercise will introduce some basics of the scripting functionality in ImageJ2
 
# 1. How to get started with script parameters
 
*What are script parameters?*
They look like this:
```python
  #@ Dataset image
  ```

* The "hash at" (#@) is used to identify a script parameter.
* The "Dataset" is the type of the input. In this case, we want an image.
* There are several types associated with images, but when in doubt, just use Dataset. :-)
* The "image" is the name of the variable.
* The input value will be assigned differently depending on the context.

Other script parameters:

An informative message
```python
  #@ String (visibility=MESSAGE, value="Please enter some parameter values", persist=false, required=false) msg
  ```

A set of predefined choices
```python
#@ String (label="Which measurement?", choices={mean,median,min,max}) measurement
```
A File parameter can have two styles: "open" (the default) or "save"
```python
#@ File (style=save, label="Save image to") destinationFile
```
A slider to choose a numeric input value
```python
#@ Double (style=slider, min=0.5, max=10, stepSize=0.5, columns=3) someValue
```
We can also define OUTPUTs.
Output parameters will be processed by the framework after executing the script.
Most known output types (e.g. numbers, text or boolean values) will be shown in a results table.

```python
#@output Boolean success

success = true
return 
```
Note that all these script parameters also work in .ijm macros! No need to use Dialog.create, Dialog.addNumber, Dialog.show etc. anymore!!

# 2. ImageJ API: SciJava Services and Ops
 
A large part of the ImageJ functionality is provided by services.
Let us introduce some of the most important services here.
We can access them easily using script parameters:
 
LogService can be used to log e.g. infos, warnings and errors
```python
#@ LogService log

log.info("This is an info message.")
log.warn("This is a warning.")
log.error("This is an error.")
```

IOService can be used to open and save images or other data
```python
#@ IOService io
baboon = io.open("https://imagej.net/images/baboon.gif")
```


UIService can be used to display an image or other data
```python
#@ UIService ui

ui.show(baboon)
```
Note that in addition to IOService, there's also DatasetIOService, which has more control over how images are opened.

Finally, there's OpService, giving access to the powerful ImageJ Ops
```python
#@ OpService ops
```
Now, for example run the "stats.mean" op. (Note that it returns an ImgLib2 Type, so we need to call getRealDouble() to get its value.)
```python
value = ops.run("stats.mean", image).getRealDouble()
```

# 3. Creating and Displaying an Image
The following piece of code (Groovy) creates and displays an 400x320 8-bit gray-level image:
```groovy
import net.imglib2.img.Img
import net.imglib2.img.array.ArrayImgFactory
import net.imglib2.type.numeric.integer.UnsignedByteType
 
// will create a window showing a black 400x320 image
long[] dimensions = [400, 320]
final Img< UnsignedByteType > img = new ArrayImgFactory<>( new UnsignedByteType() ).create( dimensions )
  ```
Breaking last two lines into individual steps...
```groovy
final ImgFactory< UnsignedByteType > factory = new ArrayImgFactory<>( new UnsignedByteType() );

final long[] dimensions = new long[] { 400, 320 };

final Img< UnsignedByteType > img = factory.create( dimensions );
```
Line 1: Pixel images in ImgLib2 are created using an **ImgFactory**. There are different ImgFactories, that create pixel containers with different memory layouts. Here, we create an **ArrayImgFactory**. This factory creates containers that map to a single flat Java array.

The type parameter of the factory specifies the value type of the image we want to create. We want to create a 8-bit gray-level image, thus we use **UnsignedByteType**.

Line 2: Next we create a **long[] array** that specifies the image size in every dimension. The length of the array specifies the number of dimensions. Here, we state that we want to create 400x320 2D image.

Line 3: We create the image, using the factory and dimensions. We store the result of the **create()** method in an **Img** variable. Img is a convenience interface that gathers properties of pixel image containers such as having a number of dimensions, being able to iterate its pixels, etc.

# 4. Opening and Displaying Image Files
You can open image files with the IO utility class of SCIFIO which calls Bio-Formats as needed. The following opens and displays an image file.

```groovy
import net.imglib2.img.Img
import net.imglib2.img.array.ArrayImgFactory
import net.imglib2.type.numeric.integer.UnsignedByteType
import io.scif.img.IO

// save path for an image of Lena
path = "https://samples.fiji.sc/new-lenna.jpg"

// load image
final Img< UnsignedByteType > img = IO.openImg( path, new ArrayImgFactory<>( new UnsignedByteType() ) );
```

When opening an image, we can specify which memory layout to use and as which value type we want to load the image. We want to use the **ArrayImg** layout again, and we want to have **UnsignedByteType** values again. We need an **ImgFactory** and an instance of the value type. We can use the **IO.openImg** method, giving a filename and **ImgFactory**.

# Exercise it

**3D spot detection in a 3-channel stack**

Goal: For each channel, detect foci and report their location
Lets try scripting with python! Download *images* folder and *Spot_Detection_Task1.py* from the above repository.
Open it on your Fiji UI!

Step 1: Open one of the images

```python
#@ File (label="Input image", style="file") input
#@ IOService io
#@ UIService ui

# Task 1.1: open a single image using io.open(path)
image = io.open(input.getPath())

# Task 1.2: find out the type/class of the returned object
print(image.class)

# Task 1.3: show the image in the UI
ui.show(image)

```

The output of image.class is **DefaultDataSet** format, which means you can access all the properties and functions of this class:
https://javadoc.scijava.org/ImageJ/net/imagej/DefaultDataset.html

```java
image = io.open(path)
image.class
image.getName()
image.dimensions(long[] dimensions)
image.getChannels()
```

Step 2: Get axis (i.e. z and channel) metadata

```python
# Task 2: find out the image dimensions and axis order
print("The image has %s dimensions." % image.numDimensions())
dims = [image.dimension(d) for d in range(image.numDimensions())]
print("The dimensions are %s" % dims)

```

Note that numDimensions returns a *long* value

Step 3: Extract single channel

Know lets use ImageJ Ops to manipulate our image.
On Fiji, Pluggins > Utilities > Find Opsâ€¦! Look for a single slice on an hyperstack

```python
#@ OpService ops

 # Task 3: Extract a the first channel (i.e. index 0 from dimension 2)
channel1 = ops.run("hyperSliceView", image, 2, 1)
print("The result has %s dimensions." % channel1.numDimensions())
 
 ```

Step 4: Apply Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) filter

```python
# Task 4: Apply a Difference of Gaussians (DoG) filter
#   NOTE: we have to convert to 'float32' to get the desired result
dog_ch1 = ops.run("filter.dog", ops.run("convert.float32", channel1), 1.5, 1.0)

```

Step 5: Detect local maxima 

Detecting local maxima using ImgLib2 **LocalExtrema**: find pixels that are extrema in their local neighborhood.
https://javadoc.scijava.org/ImgLib2/index.html?net/imglib2/algorithm/localextrema/LocalExtrema.html

```python
from net.imglib2.algorithm.localextrema import LocalExtrema
from net.imglib2.type.numeric.real import FloatType

# Task 5: Detect local maxima using LocalExtrema from ImgLib2
pointList1 = LocalExtrema.findLocalExtrema(dog_ch1, LocalExtrema.MaximumCheck(FloatType(100)))
print("The returned list has %s entries." % len(pointList1))
	
 ```

Step 6: Add maxima coordinates to results table

Populating the result table with ImageJ1 *ResultsTable*:

https://javadoc.scijava.org/ImageJ1/index.html?ij/measure/ResultsTable.html

 ```python

 #@ ResultsTable rt
 
 # Task 6: Add point coordinates to results table
for point in pointList1:
	rt.incrementCounter()
	rt.addValue("Channel", 1)
	rt.addValue("X", point.getIntPosition(0))
	rt.addValue("Y", point.getIntPosition(1))
	rt.addValue("Z", point.getIntPosition(2))

rt.show("Results")

```

Step 7: Repeat steps 3-6 for the other two channels

Define a function to perform the repetition for the other channels, where the *channel* is the variable in the function 
```python
def detectSpots(image, channel):
	# Task 3: Extract a the first channel (i.e. index 0 from dimension 2)
	channel1 = ops.run("hyperSliceView", image, 2, channel)
	print("The result has %s dimensions." % channel1.numDimensions())
	
	# Task 4: Apply a Difference of Gaussians (DoG) filter
	#   NOTE: we have to convert to 'float32' to get the desired result
	dog_ch1 = ops.run("filter.dog", ops.run("convert.float32", channel1), 1.5, 1.0)
	
	# Task 5: Detect local maxima using LocalExtrema from ImgLib2
	pointList1 = LocalExtrema.findLocalExtrema(dog_ch1, LocalExtrema.MaximumCheck(FloatType(100)))
	print("The returned list has %s entries." % len(pointList1))
	
	# Task 6: Add point coordinates to results table
	for point in pointList1:
		rt.incrementCounter()
		rt.addValue("Channel", channel)
		rt.addValue("X", point.getIntPosition(0))
		rt.addValue("Y", point.getIntPosition(1))
		rt.addValue("Z", point.getIntPosition(2))

# Task 7: Analyze the other two channels as well
detectSpots(image, 0)
detectSpots(image, 1)
detectSpots(image, 2)

rt.show("Results")
#clear table
rt.reset()

```
